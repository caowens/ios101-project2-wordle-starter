## Video Walkthrough


## Notes

I encountered many challenges when trying to create a gif. I thought that maybe the video was too long or the size was too big, but an error occurred every time I tried to submit it to Giphy. When I tried Loom, it worked once, but the gif it let's you embed is only the first few seconds (I'm assuming this happens when the video is too long).
